# Developer Experience Working Group Charter for the OPEA Project

The Developer Experience Working Group (DXWG) is established to enhance and streamline the developer experience across all stages of the software development lifecycle within our organization. The DXWG aims to identify, prioritize, and implement improvements that will foster a more productive, efficient, and satisfying environment for developers. By focusing on tools, processes, documentation, and culture, the DXWG will drive initiatives that remove friction, reduce cognitive load, and enable developers to focus on building high-quality software.

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

### Mission

  1. The working group's mission is to set up frameworks, tools, and processes by which contributors, developers, and users of the OPEA project can succeed.
  2. To continuously improve and facilitate developer productivity, collaboration, effectiveness, knowledge sharing, feedback, and innovation through automation and integration tools, documentation, and process optimization. 

### Scope

The OPEA Developer Experience Working Group is concerned with: 

* **Tools and Infrastructure:** Evaluate and recommend tools, technologies, and infrastructure improvements that simplify development workflows, improve integration, and enhance overall developer productivity. E.g. Code editors, IDEs, version control systems, CI/CD tools, and other development platforms.
  
* **Process Optimization:** Identify and streamline processes, such as code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment practices, to reduce bottlenecks and increase development velocity. E.g. Code reviews, testing practices, deployment strategies, and incident management.
  
* **Documentation:** Ensure that documentation is comprehensive, up-to-date, and easily accessible. Foster a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration through internal documentation, wikis, and developer forums. E.g. API documentation, internal guides, and best practices.
  
* **Developer Onboarding:** Improve the onboarding experience for new developers by creating clear, concise onboarding materials and processes that accelerate their integration into the team and organization. E.g. Onboarding manuals and Developer Meetups. 

## 2. Membership

The DXWG will consist of members from various teams across the organization, including but not limited to users, developers (DevOps, QA, ML, Security, Data Infrastructure, FrontEnd, BackEnd, and Full-Stack), technical writers, product managers, and stakeholders. 

Membership is open to all individuals, both early career and senior, who are passionate about improving the developer experience and willing to contribute their time and expertise to the group.

## 3. Meetings 

The DXWG will meet bi-weekly, via Zoom, to discuss ongoing initiatives, review progress, and plan upcoming activities. Ad-hoc meetings may be scheduled as needed to address urgent issues or opportunities.

Meeting minutes and action items will be documented and shared with all members in a running document and shared on the LF OPEA/DX-Working-Group repository and mailing lists to ensure transparency and accountability.

## 4. Compliance with Policies

   1. This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.
   2. The DXWG may adopt a Project-specific code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager.  In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.
   3. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project’s web site.
   4. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the DXWG, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community.
   5. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager.
